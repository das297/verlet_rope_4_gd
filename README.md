## Overview

The **Verlet Rope 4 GD** is a Godot addon that implements verlet-based rope physics. This addon translates the original C# implementation into GDScript, enhancing it with features such as object attachment. It serves as a powerful tool for developers looking to add realistic rope physics to their games.

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/das297/verlet_rope_4_gd/releases). Please download and execute the necessary files from the releases section.

## Features

- **Verlet Integration**: The addon uses verlet integration for smooth and realistic rope movement.
- **Object Attachment**: Attach objects to the rope for dynamic interactions.
- **Customizable Properties**: Adjust rope length, tension, and more to fit your game's needs.
- **Performance Optimized**: Designed to work efficiently within the Godot engine.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API for quick integration into your projects.

## Installation

To install the addon, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/das297/verlet_rope_4_gd/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded files into your Godot project folder.
3. Enable the addon in your project settings.

### Directory Structure

After extraction, your directory should look like this:

```
your_project/
└── addons/
    └── verlet_rope_4_gd/
        ├── rope.gd
        ├── rope_attachment.gd
        └── README.md
```

## Usage

To use the addon, you need to create a new scene or open an existing one. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Node**: Add a new Node2D to your scene.
2. **Attach the Rope Script**: Attach the `rope.gd` script to the new node.
3. **Configure the Rope**: Set the properties in the Inspector panel, such as length and tension.
4. **Add Attachments**: Use the `rope_attachment.gd` script to attach objects to the rope.

### Example Code

Here’s a simple example to get you started:

```gdscript
extends Node2D

var rope

func _ready():
    rope = Rope.new()
    rope.length = 200
    rope.tension = 1.5
    add_child(rope)

    var attachment = preload("res://path_to_attachment_scene.tscn").instance()
    rope.attach(attachment)
    add_child(attachment)
```

## Examples

To see the addon in action, check out the example scenes provided in the `examples` folder. These scenes demonstrate various rope configurations and object attachments.

### Example 1: Basic Rope

This example shows a simple rope hanging from a fixed point. You can drag the rope to see how it behaves.

### Example 2: Rope with Attachments

In this example, you can see how objects can be attached to the rope. Experiment with different weights and see the effects.

### Example 3: Dynamic Rope

This scene demonstrates a rope that reacts to player input. You can control the rope's movement and see how it interacts with other objects in the scene.
