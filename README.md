# 🎮 Verlet Rope for Godot 4

This project is a direct translation of the original Verlet Rope logic from C# to GDScript.

## 👏 Credits

All credits and regards should go to the original project:
https://github.com/Tshmofen/verlet-rope-4

## ✨ Features

- 🧵 Direct translation of the original C# implementation to GDScript
- 🔗 Special feature: Ability to attach objects to the end of the rope with position and rotation support

> 🚨 **Note:** The object attachment feature supports both position and rotation control. You can toggle whether attached objects should follow the rope's orientation using the `rotate_attached_object` property. These features are being developed based on the needs of specific projects, so they may or may not be useful for your particular use case. Regardless, the core functionality of the original project has been successfully ported to GDScript.
